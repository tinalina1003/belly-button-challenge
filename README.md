This is my bootcamp Module 14 Assignment, JavaScript Challenge

Please note that the javascript code written by me is under static -> js -> app.js


# Instructions

Complete the following steps:

Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

        Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

        Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

        Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

# Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

    Use otu_ids for the x values.

    Use sample_values for the y values.

    Use sample_values for the marker size.

    Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

    Use otu_labels for the text values.


Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard.
